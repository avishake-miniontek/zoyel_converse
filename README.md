### OpenAI API Compatible LLM Configuration
```json
"llm": {
    "model_name": "your_model_name",  // Name of the LLM model to use
    "api_base": "http://localhost:8000/v1",  // API endpoint
    "api_key": "your_api_key_here",  // API key for LLM service
    "conversation": {
        "context_timeout": 180,       // Seconds before conversation context expires
        "max_tokens": 8000,          // Maximum tokens for context window
        "temperature": 0.7,          // Response randomness (0.0-1.0)
        "response_max_tokens": 1024   // Maximum tokens per response
    }
}
```

### Audio Processing Settings
```json
"audio_processing": {
    "chunk_size": 2048,          // Audio processing chunk size
    "desired_rate": 16000,       // Target sample rate in Hz
    "noise_floor": {
        "initial": -50.0,        // Initial noise floor (dB)
        "min": -65.0,           // Minimum allowed noise floor (dB)
        "max": -20.0            // Maximum allowed noise floor (dB)
    }
}
```

### Speech Detection Settings
```json
"speech_detection": {
    "preroll_duration": 0.5,     // Audio capture before speech detection (seconds)
    "min_speech_duration": 0.5,  // Minimum duration to consider as speech (seconds)
    "end_silence_duration": 0.8, // Maximum silence before closing capture (seconds)
    "vad_settings": {
        "threshold": 0.3,        // Silero VAD speech detection threshold (0.0-1.0)
        "consecutive_threshold": 2  // Number of consecutive speech frames needed to trigger speech start
    }
}
```

### Client Settings
```json
"client": {
    "retry": {
        "max_attempts": 3,       // Maximum number of connection retry attempts
        "delay_seconds": 2       // Delay between retry attempts in seconds
    }
}
```

These retry settings are used for both initial server connection and automatic reconnection attempts when the connection is lost. The client will attempt to reconnect up to the specified number of attempts, waiting the specified delay between each attempt.

## Usage

1. Start the server:
```bash
python server.py
```

2. Start the client:
```bash
python client.py
```

3. The system will:
   - Initialize audio devices
   - Calibrate noise floor
   - Connect to the server
   - Open the audio control interface
   - Begin listening for the trigger word

4. Speak the trigger word (default: "Mira") followed by your query
   - Example: "Mira, tell me a joke"
   - The system will process your speech and respond through text-to-speech

## Troubleshooting

- If audio devices aren't detected:
  - Windows: Check Sound settings in Control Panel > Sound > Recording/Playback
  - Linux/macOS: Check your system's audio settings
- For GPU errors:
  - Windows: Verify CUDA installation in Device Manager > Display Adapters
  - All systems: Verify CUDA installation and GPU availability
- Connection issues:
  - Windows: Check Windows Defender Firewall settings
  - All systems: Check firewall settings and network connectivity
- For model loading errors:
  - Windows: Ensure paths use either forward slashes (C:/path) or escaped backslashes (C:\\path)
  - All systems: Verify model paths in config.json are correct
- If you experience audio issues:
  - Windows: Check audio format settings in Sound Control Panel
  - All systems: Try adjusting the VAD mode in speech_detection settings

## Architecture

MiraConverse uses a robust client-server architecture designed for scalability and efficiency:

### Server
- Centralized server that handles intensive processing tasks:
  - Speech recognition using Whisper
  - Text-to-speech synthesis using Kokoro
  - WebSocket server supporting multiple concurrent client connections
  - GPU acceleration for real-time model inference
  - Client session management with unique client IDs
  - Noise floor calibration per client

### Client
- Lightweight client focused on audio handling and user interface:
  - Efficient audio capture and streaming
  - Real-time audio level monitoring
  - WebSocket communication with automatic reconnection
  - Graphical interface for audio monitoring
  - Local audio output management
  - Minimal resource requirements (basic CPU for audio processing)

### Key Benefits
- **Scalable**: Single server can support multiple concurrent clients
- **Resource Efficient**: Heavy processing (ML models) runs on server, clients remain lightweight
- **Flexible Deployment**: Server can be run locally or on a remote machine
- **Robust Communication**: WebSocket-based protocol with authentication and automatic reconnection
- **Independent Operation**: Each client maintains its own session state and audio calibration
